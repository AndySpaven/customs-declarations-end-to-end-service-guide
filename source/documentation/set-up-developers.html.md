# Developer set-up

To develop using these APIs you must:

-	be familiar with HTTP, RESTful services, XML and OAuth2
-	be registered as a developer on the [HMRC Developer Hub] (/)
-	add at least one sandbox application on the Developer Hub

Some APIs can only be used by Community System Providers (CSPs).

To develop using these APIs you must:

- be registered as a developer on the [HMRC Developer Hub](/)
- add at least one sandbox application on the Developer Hub

Each application you register will be assigned an HMRC ‘ApplicationId’.

You can view all the applications you have registered on the [Developer Hub Applications page](/developer/applications).

There are 2 types of Developer Hub applications:

- sandbox - you start your development with these
- production - when you are ready to go live you can request 'Production Credentials' that will create you a new production application (with a new ‘ApplicationId’) in the live environment


## API subscription model

You must subscribe each application to the [CDS APIs](/api-documentation/docs/api) that they intend to use. 
Subscribing allows an application access to all of the endpoints of an API. An application may utilise as many APIs as required, but each application-API pairing must have its own subscription enabled.


## API access control

Some of the CDS APIs (and their documentation) are only accessible to applications that have been whitelisted for that API. If you cannot subscribe to or access the documentation of a particular API on the developer hub, please check with [SDST](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk) if your ‘ApplicationId’ needs to be added to the whitelist for that API.


## API versioning

In the production environment there is only one version of each CDS API (version 1.0).
In the sandbox environment however there may be more than one version of a particular API, made available for the purposes of testing new pre-release features and endpoints.  
For your application to be able to call a particular version of an API you must: 

-	ensure that your application has access to it (by checking that the version is visible to you on the API’s documentation page)
-	[subscribe your application](/documentation/set-up-developers.html#api-subscription-model) to it (in addition to any other subscriptions you have for different versions)
-	modify your application’s ‘Accept’ request header value when making a call to the API to reflect the version you wish to use (see the specific [API documentation](/documentation/set-up-developers.html#related-api-documentation) for more details on request header values)

If a version of an API is not visible on the documentation page then you may need to request to be whitelisted by [SDST](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk). 


## API rate limiting

A description of the HMRC standard rate limits can be found in the [Reference Guide on HMRC’s Developer Hub](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#rate-limiting).

Although the standard default rate limit is appropriate for current HMRC services, users of CDS are expected to generate higher volumes of API requests.

The existing automated HMRC business processes will still allocate the default rate limit to new subscriptions, but any CDS user will be able to increase their rate limit to 500 requests per minute by simply emailing their request to HMRC [SDST](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk) (including the name and ID of the applications requiring the higher limit).

As with the default limit this higher limit of 500 request per minute for CDS users is still seen as a starting point. If testing identifies a need for a higher limit further increases can be requested via the online request process.

## Related API documentation

If you cannot access any of the following API documentation please email with [SDST](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk) to check if your ‘ApplicationId’ needs to be [added to the whitelist](/documentation/set-up-developers.html#api-access-control) for that API:

- [Customs Declarations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations) - lets you submit, amend and cancel a customs declaration, and provides the ability to upload supporting documents and make arrival notifications 
- [Customs Declarations Information API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations-information) - lets you query the status of submitted customs declarations
- [Pull Notifications API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-notification-pull) - lets you “pull” business event notifications CDS has generated from requests submitted via the CDS APIs
- [Customs Inventory Linking Exports API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-inventory-linking-exports) - lets you link export declarations with specific consignments (Consolidate, Movement & Query)
- [Customs Inventory Linking Imports API (CSP only)](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-inventory-linking-imports) - lets CSPs link import declarations with specific consignments
- [Bulk Data File List (list of tariff codes)](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/secure-data-exchange-bulk-download) - lets you integrate tariff data into your customs software application, providing an initial start-up file, daily files and monthly consolidated files throughout the year


## Authentication

###Declarants and authorized agents 

The end user authenticates directly with us using their Government Gateway account, and grants authority to your software for specific scopes. We then issue an OAuth 2.0 ‘access_token’ that is specific to the end user. Your application passes the access token in subsequent API requests to user-restricted API endpoints. A user ‘access_token’ expires after 4 hours and will need to be refreshed.

Full details and examples can be found on the [HMRC Developer Hub](/)


###Community System Providers

Community System Providers (CSPs) may register privileged applications with HMRC.

Privileged applications do not require each end user to have Government Gateway credentials.

Following registration, the credentials you are supplied with can be used to generate a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) code which is exchanged for an access_token.
