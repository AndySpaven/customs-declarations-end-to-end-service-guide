# Submitting customs declarations

For both import and export declarations.

When you bring goods into the UK you must make a full declaration unless you are authorised to use simplified declarations.


## Submit new declaration

### Submitter journey overview
The submitter of a declaration can be:

- an individual trader
- an agent acting on their behalf
- a CSP

### 1. Submit declaration
Your software should use the [Customs Declarations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations) to do this - specifically the [Submit a customs declaration](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations/1.0#_submit-a-customs-declaration_post_accordion) endpoint.

If you are a CSP you must identify the originating party of the declaration.

### 2. Receive response
You will receive a synchronous response confirming that your declaration has been received.

This response will include a Conversation ID that you can use to identify notifications for your declaration.


### 3. Receive notifications related to declaration
After a short time one or more notifications related to your declaration will be generated.

How you receive notifications depends on whether you have set up [push or pull notifications](/documentation/notifications.html) for your subscription to the [Customs Declarations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations).

The exact message flow and types of notifications that you can expect to receive during the declarationâ€™s life cycle depends on the type of declaration you are submitting. A detailed explanation of all the different declaration types and their process flow can be found in the [CDS 10 End to End Sequence Diagrams document](/documentation/resources/CDS 10 End to End Sequence Diagrams v5.2 20200409.docx).


## Amend a submitted customs declaration

CDS allows the submission of declaration amendments which will cause a re-validation of the declaration. 

Your software should use the [Customs Declarations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations) to do this, specifically the [Submit a Customs Amend Declaration endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations#_submit-a-customs-amend-declaration_post_accordion).

Amending a declaration follows a similar process to submitting. The exact message flow and types of notifications that you can expect to receive after an amendment depends on the type of declaration you are amending. A detailed explanation of all the different declaration types and their process flow can be found in the [CDS 10 End to End Sequence Diagrams document](/documentation/resources/CDS 10 End to End Sequence Diagrams v5.2 20200409.docx).


## Cancel a submitted customs declaration

To cancel (also known as invalidate) a submitted declaration your software should use the [Customs Declarations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations) to do this, specifically the Submit a cancellation request endpoint.

The exact message flow can be found in the [CDS 10 End to End Sequence Diagrams document](/documentation/resources/CDS 10 End to End Sequence Diagrams v5.2 20200409.docx)
